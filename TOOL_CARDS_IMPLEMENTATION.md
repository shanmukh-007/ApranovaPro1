# Tool Cards Implementation

## What to Add

Based on the screenshot, add tool cards similar to the Apache Superset card shown:

### For DP (Data Professional) Track:
1. **Apache Superset** - Build your data visualizations
2. **Prefect** - Automate your workflows  
3. **Jupyter Notebook** - Analyze data interactively
4. **PostgreSQL** - Your database workspace
5. **Discord** - Join the community

### For FSD (Full-Stack Developer) Track:
1. **CodeServer** - Your cloud IDE
2. **GitHub** - Version control
3. **Discord** - Join the community

## Card Design (from screenshot):
- Green border with dark background
- Icon on the left
- Tool name as title
- Description below
- "Open [Tool]" button on the right (green)

## Where to Add:
After the project progress card, before the project steps section.

## Implementation:
Add a new section in the dashboard that shows track-specific tools with links to open them.
